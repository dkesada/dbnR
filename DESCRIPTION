Description: Learning and inference over dynamic Bayesian networks of arbitrary 
    Markovian order.  Extends some of the functionality offered by the 'bnlearn' 
    package to learn the networks from data and perform exact inference. 
    It offers a modification of Trabelsi (2013) <doi:10.1007/978-3-642-41398-8_34> 
    dynamic max-min hill climbing algorithm for structure learning and 
    the possibility to perform forecasts of arbitrary length. A tool for 
    visualizing the structure of the net is also provided via the 'visNetwork' package.
