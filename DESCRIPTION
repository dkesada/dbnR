Description: Learning and inference over dynamic Bayesian networks of arbitrary 
    Markovian order. Extends some of the functionality offered by the 'bnlearn' 
    package to learn the networks from data and perform exact inference. 
    It offers two structure learning algorithms for dynamic Bayesian networks
    and the possibility to perform forecasts of arbitrary length. A tool for 
    visualizing the structure of the net is also provided via the 'visNetwork' 
    package.
