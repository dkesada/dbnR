    "\n",
    "In this notebook I will explain how can we use the _dbnR_ package in Python with the _rpy2_ library. It is very common to code in several languages, and I've come across the problem of having to use Python to deploy DBN models when all my code is done in R. I will show how can we use the _rpy2_ library to fit a DBN model and predict with it. This is not a perfect solution, but it gets the job done.\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, we will need a working Python environment with _rpy2_ installed. In my case, I will be defining a new conda environment for this purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Shell\n",
    "conda create -n rpy2 python=3.7.0\n",
    "conda activate rpy2\n",
    "pip install rpy2\n",
    "conda install -c anaconda pandas\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will get us a working environment with a local R distribution that we will need to populate with our desired R packages, in our case _dbnR_ and its dependencies."

    "If you run into R '.dll' files not found errors after executing `import rpy2.robjects as robj`, then you need to fiddle with your environment variables so that the R binaries are in your path. I had to add several environment variables on Windows. I'll list them in case it solves some possible problems in the future, and take care to put the correct R version, user name and path. Notice how I'm using miniconda, if you are using conda or not using it at all, you have to adjust the path to _rpy2_ accordingly. Only add the 'R_USER' variable if you want to set a specific _rpy2_ library, because it will mess your other R libraries paths. If you are using Rstudio or some other R interpreter, it will default to the _rpy2_ library and that is likely not a good thing.\n",

    "The simplest way of doing this would be using the _utils_ base R package to install other packages from CRAN. In case we need to install the GitHub version, we first need the _devtools_ package and that is trickier. If we locate the R library of the _rpy2_ environment we could also install it by hand, but that would not be optimal. The last option is to change the library path of _rpy2_ to the one we normally use in R, that way we will be able to install packages directly from R and we will be able to just use them in _rpy2_.\n",

    "With this, we cover the basic use of the _dbnR_ package from Python. This still requires R running in the background, so it is not a Python port by any means. The results are also converted to pandas dataframes automatically by _rpy2_. On this notebook, the R plots always crashed the Python kernel, so I would advise against them. The visualization of the network doesn't translate into Python either, as it was to be expected. Even so, the model can still be learned, used and deployed without issues. The most troublesome part was getting the right R library linked with _rpy2_ by fiddling with the environment variables (if you are working on Windows). The only other issues I saw were the plot crashing the kernel and the arguments containing the character '.' generating errors."
