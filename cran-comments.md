## Update submission
Update from version 0.7.9 to 0.8.0. In this update, after publishing the package in the Journal of Statistical Software I added a CITATION file that links to this article and referenced the new DOI in the DESCRIPTION file. The DOI in the CITATION is for a new JSS publication that will be registered after publication on CRAN.
